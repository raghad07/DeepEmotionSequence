# Sequence Modeling Project
This project is focused on sequence modeling using TensorFlow. It involves training different models to analyze and predict emotions based on textual data. The models are designed to understand and classify emotions in sentences.

# Project Overview
Data: The project utilizes a dataset of labeled emotional text data, which is divided into training and testing sets.

#Data Preprocessing: The text data is tokenized and padded to ensure consistent sequence lengths for training the models. The emotion labels are also processed to prepare them for training.

# Modeling: Several sequence modeling models are implemented and trained using the preprocessed data. The models include:

RNN Model: A basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is used to analyze the sequential nature of the input data and make emotion predictions.
LSTM Model: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are employed to capture long-range dependencies in the text data and improve emotion classification performance.
DNN with Embedding Layers: A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model with embedding layers is used to map the text data into continuous vectors and make predictions based on those representations.
Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated on both training and testing data to assess their performance in emotion prediction. The accuracy of the models is measured, and appropriate metrics are used to analyze their effectiveness.

Best Model: The Bidirectional LSTM model is selected as the best-performing model based on its training and validation accuracy.


# Results
The project aims to achieve a training accuracy of at least 94% and a validation accuracy of at least 88% on the emotion prediction task. The final results and performance metrics of each model will be documented and shared in the project's results folder.
